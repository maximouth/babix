* What it IS
------------
- Babix is a little preemptive multitask kernel for Arduino Due.
- It is mostly dedicated for educational purposes.
- It is basic and simple and aims at showing the principles underlying
  preemptive kernels.
- User processes must currently be endless loops.
- The main user process (the standard loop () function) is ran only if there
  is no other processes.

It is written in C with some inevitable assembly inlines.
Even if some files are suffixed by ".cpp", it is C. The C++ is only to
use Serial.print () for debug or feedback printing.

The code is heavily commented with the hope this will help readers.


* What it is NOT
----------------
- A complete OS
- A real-time kernel
- A fully optimized kernel.


* What it may become or have in the future
------------------------------------------
- A bit more encapsulated.
- A bit more robust.
- Some synchronization primitives.
- Some inter-process communication primitives.
- A bit more configurable.
- Really handle or replace the function delay () of the Arduino "standard
  library" (currently not really respecting the delays: may be longer than
  requested).
- Allows processes to end (instead of forcibly infinite loops).
- Allow processes to be suspended / restarted (a kind of status for the
  processes).
- ... ???


* Other works from other people
-------------------------------
- FreeRTOS (http://www.freertos.org)
  A really more complex and complete real-time OS.

- ChibiOS/RT (http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php)
  Also a really more complex and complete real-time OS.

- nisos (https://github.com/uditha-atukorala/nisos)
  A basic multitasking OS written in C++ more complex than Babix.
